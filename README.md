üìù Task
- In this project, I developed an API and a database for content production in a blog. I used Node.js and the Sequelize ORM to perform CRUD operations on the posts.
- The endpoints were connected to the database, following the principles of REST. To create a post, it is necessary to have an authenticated user with JWT. Authentication is done through tokens, which are validated in requests that require authentication.
